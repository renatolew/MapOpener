# MapScrap
A small project to start exercising web scraping. My goal in this project is to consolidate the knowledge obtained in web scraping during the "Automate the boring stuff with Python" course. All constructive feedback is welcomed and encouraged!

In order to execute this project you will need Python installed in your computer. In order to edit or complement the code you will need a text editor or IDE of your choice. I recommend Jetbrains Pycharm. You can find links to install these features below:
